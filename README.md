# ventricular_myocyte_models

This folder contains the basic code for different ventricular myocyte models. 

Please note the following:
1) If you are downloading only a single model, please also download the find_APD.m function. 
APD is calculated as difference between time of stimulus and time when voltage returns to -75 mV. 

2) The stimulus protocal can be changed by altering the variables in Step 2. 

3) The human models have the option of simulating different cell types (epi,M,endo). The default setting is endo and can be altered by changing the "celltype" variable in Step 1.
