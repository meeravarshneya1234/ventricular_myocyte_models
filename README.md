# ventricular_myocyte_models

This folder contains the basic code for different ventricular myocyte models. 

Please note the following:
1) The stimulus protocal can be changed by altering the variables in Step 2. 
2) The human models have the option of simulating different cell types (epi,M,endo). The default setting is endo and can be altered by changing the "celltype" variable in Step 1.
